To install and run the sample (JDeveloper):
===========================================

1. Ensure the mafmcsutility.jar file is referenced from the public sample ApplicationController project (Library as JAR)

2. Choose Run-> Active Run Configuration —> target (iOS or Android) for simulator or emulator. Then select ViewController project and choose “Run” from the menu or toolbar

3. To deploy the application on the device, you need a Apple certificate (for iOS) and change the application bundle Id (Application properties -> Deployment), or a self-signed Java certificate (Android) 

4. When deploying to the device, ensure you deploy in release mode (setting on the Android and iOS deployment profiles in the Aplication Properties deployment settings)

Note: The public sample is optimized for the use in tablets though it can run on smartphones too.

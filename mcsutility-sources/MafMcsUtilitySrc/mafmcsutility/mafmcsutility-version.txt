MAF MCS Utility version 2.3

Changes to MAF MCS Utility 2.1.3 and MAFF MCS Utility 2.2.1
==================================================================================

1. Added OAUTH support

2. Moved MBEConfiguration class from com.oracle.maf.sample.mcs.shared.mbe to com.oracle.maf.sample.mcs.shared.mbe.config

3. MBEConfiguration is a base class that is left in for backward compatibility to MAF MCS Utility 2.1.3. Applications 
   should use one of the new new BasicAuthMBEConfiguration or OauthMBEConfiguration to create MBEConfiguration objects 
   for MBE that uses basic authentication or oauth

3. getMobileBackendId() in MBEConfiguration has been renamed to getMobileBackendIdentifier and holds the value of the 
   mobile backend Id if basic authentication is used or the value if the client ID if OAUTH is used. 
   
5. Added support for MCS MCE application policies
